## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial setup phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, several challenges have been identified:

1. **Neovim API Limitations**
   - Some UI interactions may be constrained by terminal capabilities
   - Potential workarounds being researched

2. **AI Provider Constraints**
   - Token limitations will require careful context management
   - Rate limiting strategies needed for development and production

3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**
   - Browser automation has different requirements across platforms
   - Terminal behavior varies between environments
