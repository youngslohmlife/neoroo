# Active Context for Neoroo

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. We have established the project brief and are building out the Memory Bank documentation structure to guide development. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Project Documentation Setup**
   - Creating the Memory Bank structure
   - Establishing clear documentation patterns
   - Defining the project scope and boundaries

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Designing the core plugin architecture
   - Defining component relationships
   - Establishing technical patterns

3. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Preparing the Neovim development environment
   - Setting up testing infrastructure
   - Establishing workflow patterns

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created initial project repository
   - Established .gitignore and .gitattributes
   - Set up basic Lua configuration (.luarc.json)

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created projectbrief.md defining core requirements
   - Established Memory Bank documentation pattern
   - Added productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Create progress.md to track development status
   - Establish .clinerules for project-specific patterns
   - Review and refine existing documentation

2. **Core Infrastructure Development**
   - Implement basic plugin structure
   - Create module organization
   - Set up configuration system

3. **Neovim Integration Foundation**
   - Implement buffer management utilities
   - Create command registration system
   - Establish event handling framework

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)

1. **Basic Chat Interface**
   - Implement split-window UI
   - Create buffer-based chat display
   - Add basic input handling

2. **AI Provider Integration**
   - Implement provider abstraction layer
   - Add OpenAI integration
   - Create response parsing utilities

3. **Initial Testing Framework**
   - Set up unit testing structure
   - Create mock AI provider for testing
   - Implement basic integration tests

### Medium-term Goals (3-4 weeks)

1. **Tool System Foundation**
   - Implement file operation tools
   - Add terminal execution capability
   - Create tool protocol framework

2. **Mode System Implementation**
   - Create mode switching mechanism
   - Implement built-in modes (Code, Architect, Debug, Ask)
   - Add mode-specific UI indicators

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Plugin Structure**
   - Decision needed on module organization
   - Considering feature-based vs. layer-based organization
   - Evaluating lazy-loading boundaries

2. **UI Approach**
   - Evaluating buffer-based vs. floating window approaches for different UI elements
   - Considering integration with existing UI libraries vs. custom implementation
   - Determining the balance between native Vim feel and modern interactions

3. **State Management**
   - Deciding on centralized vs. distributed state management
   - Evaluating persistence mechanisms
   - Considering state migration strategies for updates

### Technical Considerations

1. **Neovim Version Support**
   - Currently targeting Neovim 0.9.0+ as minimum version
   - Monitoring upcoming Neovim features for potential integration
   - Considering polyfill strategies for backward compatibility

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identifying potential performance bottlenecks
   - Planning for large codebase handling
   - Considering incremental processing strategies

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Determining test coverage goals
   - Planning for AI service mocking
   - Considering end-to-end testing approach

### Open Questions

1. **AI Provider Selection**
   - Which providers should be supported in the initial release?
   - How should provider-specific features be handled?
   - What fallback mechanisms should be implemented?

2. **Browser Integration**
   - What is the minimum viable browser integration?
   - How should browser dependencies be managed?
   - What are the cross-platform considerations?

3. **LSP Integration Depth**
   - How deeply should Neoroo integrate with LSP?
   - Should Neoroo provide its own LSP-like features?
   - How should conflicts with existing LSP configurations be handled?

## Current Blockers

1. **Development Environment Standardization**
   - Need to establish consistent development environment
   - Determining minimum required tools and versions
   - Creating setup documentation

2. **API Access**
   - Securing API keys for development
   - Establishing testing accounts
   - Determining rate limit handling strategy

3. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Finalizing architecture documentation
   - Establishing API documentation standards
   - Creating user-facing documentation plan

## Recent Insights

1. The modal nature of Neovim provides unique opportunities for AI interaction patterns that differ from traditional IDE integrations.

2. Buffer-based interactions align well with Neovim's philosophy and provide a familiar interface for users.

3. The plugin ecosystem in Neovim requires careful consideration of compatibility and resource sharing.

4. The async capabilities of Neovim are essential for maintaining responsiveness during AI operations.

5. The extensibility model of Neovim allows for powerful customization but requires clear boundaries and interfaces.
