# neoroo - Autonomous AI Coding Agent for Neovim

## Project Vision

Create a native Neovim plugin that brings the full power of Roo-Code's autonomous coding capabilities to Neovim users, while respecting and leveraging Neovim's modal editing and extensibility model.

## Core Requirements

### 1. AI Integration & Modes
- Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom providers)
- Implement specialized modes (Code, Architect, Debug, Ask)
- Custom mode creation through declarative configuration
- Memory system for contextual awareness across sessions

### 2. Native Neovim Interface
- Modal-first UX adhering to Vim principles
- Split-window chat interface with proper syntax highlighting
- Floating windows for inline code suggestions
- Buffer-based interaction model
- Tree-sitter integration for precise code understanding
- Text objects for AI interactions
- Telescope integration for mode/command selection

### 3. Tool Integration
- Buffer reading/writing with atomic operations
- Terminal command execution with output capture
- Headless browser control for web interactions
- Custom tool protocol (MCP) implementation
- Git integration for version control awareness
- LSP-aware code modifications

### 4. Developer Experience
- Extensive Lua API for customization
- Event system for plugin interop
- Custom keymaps and commands
- Async operations for responsiveness
- Detailed debugging capabilities
- Local state persistence

## Technical Constraints

- Written in Lua for Neovim 0.9.0+
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Minimal external dependencies
- Support for remote plugins via RPC
- Test coverage requirement: 80%+

## Success Criteria

1. Feature parity with Roo-Code's core capabilities
2. Native feel within Neovim environment
3. Response time < 100ms for UI operations
4. Stable API for plugin ecosystem
5. Comprehensive documentation
6. Active community engagement

## Out of Scope

- GUI windows or Electron components
- VSCode-specific integrations
- Platform-dependent features
- Web-based configuration UI

## Development Phases

1. Core Infrastructure
   - Plugin architecture
   - AI provider integration
   - Base UI components

2. Feature Implementation
   - Mode system
   - Tool integration
   - Buffer management

3. Advanced Features
   - Custom modes
   - MCP protocol
   - Browser control

4. Polish & Performance
   - Optimization
   - Documentation
   - Community features

## Quality Standards

- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Performance benchmarks
- Security review process
- Consistent code style
- Clear error handling

## Resources Required

- Neovim plugin development expertise
- AI integration experience
- System architecture knowledge
- Community management
- Technical writing

## Integration Points

- Neovim API
- Tree-sitter
- LSP
- External AI providers
- Terminal multiplexers
- Version control systems
- Browser automation tools

## Risk Factors

1. AI API reliability
2. Performance with large codebases
3. Cross-platform compatibility
4. Security considerations
5. Breaking Neovim API changes

## Initial Milestones

1. Basic chat interface (2 weeks)
2. Core AI integration (2 weeks)
3. File operations (1 week)
4. Terminal integration (1 week)
5. Mode system (2 weeks)
6. Initial release (1 week)

## Maintenance Commitment

- Regular updates aligned with Neovim releases
- Security patches within 48 hours
- Community-driven feature prioritization
- Quarterly roadmap reviews

This project aims to create a powerful, native Neovim experience for AI-assisted coding while maintaining the efficiency and extensibility that Neovim users expect.
