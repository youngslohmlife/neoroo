# Product Context for Neoroo

## Why This Project Exists

Neoroo exists to bridge the gap between powerful AI coding assistants and the Neovim ecosystem. While AI coding tools have become increasingly sophisticated, Neovim users often face a choice between:

1. Using external AI tools that break their workflow and modal editing paradigm
2. Using simplified AI integrations that lack the full capabilities of dedicated AI coding assistants

Neoroo solves this problem by bringing comprehensive AI coding capabilities directly into Neovim, preserving the modal editing workflow and extensibility that Neovim users value.

## Problems Neoroo Solves

1. **Workflow Disruption**: Current AI coding solutions often require context switching between the editor and external tools, breaking the flow state of developers.

2. **Modal Editing Incompatibility**: Most AI coding assistants aren't designed with modal editing in mind, creating friction for Vim/Neovim users.

3. **Limited Integration**: Existing Neovim AI plugins typically offer limited functionality compared to standalone AI coding assistants.

4. **Customization Barriers**: Neovim users expect high levels of customization, which many AI tools don't provide.

5. **Performance Overhead**: External AI tools can introduce latency and resource consumption that impacts the lightweight nature of Neovim.

## How Neoroo Should Work

Neoroo should feel like a natural extension of Neovim, not an external tool bolted onto it. This means:

1. **Modal-First Design**: All interactions should respect and leverage Vim's modal editing paradigm.

2. **Buffer-Based Interface**: Using Neovim's buffer system for displaying AI interactions, maintaining consistency with the Neovim experience.

3. **Command-Line Integration**: Leveraging Neovim's command-line for quick actions and mode switching.

4. **Keybinding Harmony**: Following Vim keybinding conventions and allowing extensive customization.

5. **Asynchronous Operation**: Ensuring the editor remains responsive during AI operations.

6. **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding the current buffer, cursor position, and selected text to provide relevant assistance.

7. **Seamless Tool Integration**: Integrating with the filesystem, terminal, and other tools without breaking the user's flow.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Invisibility When Unused**: Neoroo should have minimal presence when not actively being used, preserving the clean Neovim interface.

2. **Immediate Availability**: When needed, Neoroo should be accessible with minimal keystrokes.

3. **Predictable Interactions**: Users should be able to anticipate how Neoroo will behave based on their knowledge of Vim/Neovim.

4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple operations should be simple, while advanced features should be discoverable as needed.

5. **Feedback Clarity**: Users should always understand what Neoroo is doing and why, especially during longer operations.

6. **Failure Resilience**: When AI operations fail or produce unexpected results, users should have clear paths to recover or refine.

7. **Learning Curve Alignment**: The learning curve should align with Neovim's - a steeper initial curve with significant long-term productivity gains.

8. **Configuration Consistency**: Configuration should follow Neovim conventions, using Lua for advanced customization.

## Target Users

1. **Primary**: Experienced Neovim users who want to incorporate AI assistance without compromising their workflow.

2. **Secondary**: Developers interested in AI coding tools who prefer terminal-based, keyboard-driven environments.

3. **Tertiary**: Teams with mixed editor preferences who want consistent AI capabilities across different environments.

## Success Indicators

From a user perspective, Neoroo will be successful when:

1. Users can accomplish AI-assisted tasks without leaving their flow state
2. The time from intention to result is shorter than alternative approaches
3. Users feel the tool enhances rather than replaces their expertise
4. The learning investment yields proportional productivity returns
5. Users advocate for Neoroo within the Neovim community

## Anti-Goals

Neoroo explicitly avoids:

1. Mimicking GUI-based AI assistants
2. Prioritizing flashy features over Vim-like efficiency
3. Imposing workflow changes that contradict Vim philosophy
4. Becoming a general-purpose AI interface beyond coding contexts
5. Requiring cloud dependencies for core functionality
